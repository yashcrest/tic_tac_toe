# Simple Tic Tac Toe using Javascript
This project helps on embracing the following: 
Variables and Data Types:

Storing player names, game states, scores, and the current player.
Using arrays to represent the game board.
DOM Manipulation:

Selecting elements from the HTML (e.g., cells, buttons, score displays).
Adding, removing, or toggling CSS classes.
Modifying element content.
Responding to events (clicks, etc.).
Functions:

Structuring code by breaking down tasks into functions (e.g., initializing the game, handling cell clicks, checking for a win).
Control Structures:

Using loops, like for or forEach, to iterate over cells or winning combinations.
Conditional statements (if/else) to determine game outcomes or player turns.
Events:

Handling and responding to user interactions, such as cell clicks or button presses.
Adding and removing event listeners.
Arrays and Array Methods:

Representing the game board and storing the state of each cell.
Utilizing methods like forEach, every, and fill.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (optional):

If you decide to structure your game using classes, you'll dive into creating classes, instances, methods, and properties.
Ternary Operator:

This can be used for short conditional checks, like toggling between players.
Algorithmic Thinking:

Coming up with the logic to check for a winning combination or a draw situation.
